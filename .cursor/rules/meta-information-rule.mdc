alwaysApply: true

- Whenever you learn something structural about the project (e.g., architecture decisions, module responsibilities, key invariants, file relationships, design goals, overll aim of the project) add it to a centralized meta-document.txt in .cursor folder.
- read .cursor/meta-document.txt in the beginning of every request.
- update .cursor/meta-document.txt at the end of your research about the project uppon the requests. The information in the request prompt has higher priority.
- .cursor/meta-document.txt helps with consistency across sessions, architectural reasoning, refactoring, generating new files that match the project’s structure, keeping assumptions explicit instead of implicit.
- The .cursor/meta-document.txt may refer to other files that has to be maintained as well the same way as .cursor/meta-document.txt.
- Use it as a stable source of truth.
- If the .cursor/meta-document.txt does not exist, initialize it after analyzing the whole project.
